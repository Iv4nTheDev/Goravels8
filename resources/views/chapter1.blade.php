                            <b>What is Network Security?</b>
                            <br>Network security is the process of taking preventative measures to protect the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, malfunction, modification, destruction or improper disclosure.
                            <p class="mx-auto text-justify font-medium leading-relaxed text-gray-900 lg:w-1/2 "> 
                            <br>The Internet has undoubtedly become a huge part of our lives. Many people in today’s generation rely on the Internet for many of their professional, social and personal activities. But are you sure your network is secure?
                            There are many people who attempt to damage our Internet-connected computers, violate our privacy and make it impossible to the Internet services. Given the frequency and variety of existing attacks as well as the threat of new and more destructive future attacks, network security has become a central topic in the field of cybersecurity. Implementing network security measures allows computers, users and programs to perform their permitted critical functions within a secure environment.                            </p>

                            <br><b>How can we ensure network security?</b>
                            <br>We must ensure that the passwords are Strong and Complex everywhere- within the network too, not just on individual computers within an org. These passwords cannot be simple , default and easily guessable ones. This simple step can go a long way toward securing your networks.
