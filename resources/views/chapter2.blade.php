                            You can’t defend yourself from threats you don’t understand. While malware and phishing are fairly familiar terms, the mechanics of these types of cyber attacks is less well known.
                            Understanding the method of delivery will help clarify the role of different security controls required to combat the common threats.
                            It’s discomforting being aware of the threats, but not knowing where they’re coming from and how to defend yourself can be even more disconcerting.
                            In this chapter, we break down the 8 most common forms of attack and how to defend yourself and your business against them                            <p class="mx-auto text-justify font-medium leading-relaxed text-gray-700 lg:w-1/2 ">

                            <b>Phishing & Social Engineering Attacks </b>
                            Phishing involves sending emails that appear to be from trusted sources. The aim is to gain your sensitive information, or to spread malware. Part confidence trick and part hacking, phishing is one of the easiest (and therefore, the most common) ways to breach a company’s security. Think of it as a way to find out your password – a highly effective password attack.
                            Spear phishing has the same outcome, but uses a more focused approach. These attacks require a bit more research on an individual or a target user group. For example, with a little online research, a phisher can identify your colleague’s email addresses and send what appears to be a legitimate email from a trusted source instructing your users to download a file (malware), or even hand over the login details to a key business application.

                            <b>How to Protect Yourself from Phishing & Social Engineering Attacks</b>
                            <br>&#8226 Educate your self on the correct protocols for password security.
                            <br>&#8226 Check that links go to the URL they say they will (hover over links before clicking).
                            <br>&#8226 Look at email header “Reply-to” and “Return-Path” to ensure it matches the source you believe the email is from.

                            <br><b>Password Attacks & Credential Reuse </b>
                            This is probably the first type of attack that springs to mind when you talk to your users about cyber security. And yet, despite the risks being well known, people fail to use strong passwords, inadvertently give them away to phishing scammers or scribble them on bits of paper.
                            A hacker will use an array of password hacking techniques, from using lists of common ‘weak’ passwords, to sophisticated ‘Rainbow table’ attacks, using previously hacked/cracked lists of hashed passwords.  <br> <br>
                            <b>How to Protect Yourself from Password Attacks & Credential Reuse</b>
                 
                            <br>&#8226 Educate your users on phishing methods.
                            <br>&#8226 Encourage & enforce the use of strong, unique passwords.
                            <br>&#8226 Implement an account lockout policy.

                            <br><b>Denial-of-Service Attacks</b>
                            There’s a variety of DoS and DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. Don’t be misled by the fun-sounding names. These attacks will have devastating consequences on your business. The most common are teardrop attack, smurf attack, TCP SYN flood attack, ping-of-death, and botnets.
                            DoS & DDos attacks hurt businesses by flooding target web servers with requests – stopping your regular users connecting. This means website downtime, disappointed customers, reputation damage and can even result in data losses & compensation payouts.

                            <b>How to Protect Business from Denial-of-Service Attacks</b>
                            <br>&#8226 If you don’t have “always-on” DoS protection, make sure you do have protocols in place to help you stop an attack, or at least minimise the impact.
                            <br>&#8226 It is not enough to hope that your firewalls and ISP are able to stop the heavy loads that attackers use today. There are three main options to consider for DoS protection:
                            <br>On-premise protection to identify, filter, detect and protect your network.
                            <br>Cloud-based counteraction to deflect, absorb, reroute and scrub.
                            <br>Hybrid solution (combining on-prem and cloud DoS protection).

                            <br><b>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)</b>
                            As the name suggests, a Man-in-the-Middle attack is when a hacker inserts themselves between two legitimate hosts. It’s the cyber equivalent of eavesdropping on a private conversation.
                            In fact, an Eavesdropping attack is a common type of attack itself. But the MitM attack goes a step further. The MitM attack has the added malevolence of disguising itself as one, or both of the people speaking.
                            This means it doesn’t just intercept and listen into messages between clients and servers. It can also change the messages and plant requests that appear to be from a legitimate source. These type of attacks are notoriously difficult to detect – but there are preventative measures you can take.           
                            <br> <br>
                            <b>Preventing MitM attacks:</b>
                            <br>&#8226 Make sure you use SSL certificates (HTTPS, not just HTTP) to enhance security (and user trust) in your website / extranet.
                            <br>&#8226 Consider an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
                            <br>&#8226 Set-up a VPN to add additional layers of protection over Wi-Fi (and other confidential networks).

                            <br><b>SQL Injections</b>
                            A Structured Query Language (SQL) injection is when malicious code is inserted into an SQL database. For an attacker, it can be as simple as submitting malicious code into a website’s search box.
                            Once the code’s been unleashed, it can read, modify or delete your data. Some SQL attacks can even shutdown your database and issue commands to your operating system.  
                            <br> <br>
                            <b>How to protect against SQL injection attacks:</b>
                            <br>&#8226 Apply a least-privilege permissions model in your databases.
                            <br>&#8226 Stick to stored procedures (exclude dynamic SQL) and prepared statements (parameterized queries).
                            <br>&#8226 Validate SQL data inputs against a whitelist.

                            If a user uncovers a security risk in a program, they may well notify the software company so they can develop and issue a security patch to fix the issue. But they may also share their discovery online too.
                            The next thing you know, this well-meaning user (who only wanted to warn others) has just exposed a vulnerability to the world. And guess who’s scouring the internet for exactly this type of information? While the software developers rush to fix the problem, hackers get busy exploiting it

                            <br><b>Cross-site Scripting (XSS)</b>
                            This attack usually runs in conjunction with social engineering because it requires a user to visit a web page where the hacker has inserted malicious script.
                            When you land on an infected web page, the malicious payload can leave you exposed to a variety of unpleasant consequences. In a worst-case scenario, the XSS attack can access webcams, microphones, log keystrokes and even take remote control over your machine. The most common vehicle is JavaScript as it is so widely used across the web.

                            <b>How to prevent XXS attacks:</b>
                            <br>&#8226 Ensure your users are educated on phishing techniques.

                            Unlike many other types of cyber attack, you don’t have to open an email attachment or download anything to become infected. A drive-by download can take advantage of an operating system, web browser or app that has vulnerabilities (due to a lack of security updates). It can be transmitted when you simply view an email, pop-up or website.
